# A React app using Vite
This is my playground for frontend development.

Currently the app:
- uses Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) as the preprocessor scripting langauge to extend CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). .sass files are compiled into standard CSS files in runtime that can be understood by web browsers.
- configures pre-commit hook using Husky.
- uses carbon/react UI library.
